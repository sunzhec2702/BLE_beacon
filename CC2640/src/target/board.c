 @file  board.c

 @brief This file is a simple gateway to include the appropriate board.h file
        which is located in a corresponding subdirectory relative to this file.
        In this way, all projects look the same and only need to include this
        board.h. To change a board, the project only need update the board
        define. Presently, the following board targets are possible:

        BOOSTXL_CC2650MA
        CC2650_LAUNCHXL
        CC2650DK_4XS
        CC2650DK_5XD
        CC2650DK_7ID
        CC2650RC
        CC2650STK
        CC1310_LAUNCHXL
        CC1310DK_4XD
        CC1310DK_5XD
        CC1310DK_7XD
        CC1350_LAUNCHXL
        CC1350STK

        If a project needs to change the board defined for a particular target,
        they can modify the board.h located in the corresponding board
        subdirectory.

        NOTE: THIS FILE SHOULD ONLY BE CHANGED TO ADD A NEW BOARD/TARGET!

 Group: WCS, LPC, BTS
 Target Device: CC2650, CC2640, CC1350
